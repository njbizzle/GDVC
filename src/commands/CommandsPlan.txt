Terminology:
You checkout a project before you commit to it. If multiple commits derive from a single other commit, there is an offshoot.


/ create (name, prefix, ?initial_id) (permissions - any)

    name:str - The name of the project.
    prefix:str - The characters used to prefix the command. All spaces will be removed and replaced with underscores.
    initial_id:int - The id of the first commit. What will appear when someone attempts to checkout the project. (Defaults to 0)

    Creates a new project and adds the initial commit. The initial commit will have a description of "Initial commit.", be authored by the person running the command.


/ checkout (?commit_id, ?desc) (permissions - commit)

    commit_id:int - The id of the commit you are checking out. (Defaults to most recent commit)
    desc:int - Short description of the intentions of the checkout.

    If the project isn't already checked out, it checks out the last commit.


/ cancel_checkout () (permissions - moderate)

    Cancels the current checkout if there is any.


/ commit (id, desc, ?parent_commit) (permissions - commit)

    id:int - The id of the level in Geometry Dash.
    desc:str - Short description of what was done in the commit.
    parent_commit:int (moderate) - The id of the commit for this to be after. This overrides any checkout and requires moderator perms.

    If the project is checked out under the user account, it will push a new commit to the project with the information specified.

/ view (commit_id:commit_index... ) (permissions - view)

    commit_id:int - The id of the commit that you want to specify a specific offshoot from.
    commit_index:int - The index of the offshoot. If not specified each will default to the first commit, which is by default the earliest.

    Displays the project and all its commits, defaulting to the first offshoot if there are multiple commits.


/ reorder (commit_id, move_index, ?target_index) (permissions - moderate)

    commit_id:int - The id of the commit that you want to reoder the offshoots of.
    move_index:int - The index of the offshoot on the commit you want to reoder.
    target_index:int - The target index of the offshoot at the move index. (Defaults to 0, making it the most prioritized)


/ prune (commit_id) (permissions - moderate)

    commit_id:int The id of the commit to remove.

    Removes a commit, disconnecting all that derive from it.

    admin:role - Anyone with this role can configure the project and has access to all commands. (Defaults to @everyone)
